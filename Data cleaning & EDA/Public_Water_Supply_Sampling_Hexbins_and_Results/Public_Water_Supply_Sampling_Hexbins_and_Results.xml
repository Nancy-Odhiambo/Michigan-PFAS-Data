            <abstract>Hexbin data (PFAS test results) for public water supplies come from two different sources: 1) EGLE’s statewide PFAS survey, which tested supplies between 2018 and 2020, prior to Michigan’s PFAS maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), and 2) PFAS MCL compliance monitoring results under Michigan’s Safe Drinking Water Act. (2020 – present). Use the TaskType field to differentiate the Statewide Surveillance PFAS data (StateSurv) versus the PFAS Compliance Monitoring data (ComplMon).The locations that have been sampled in this effort include Community Water Supplies (including regional and municipal water supplies, manufactured housing communities, residential apartment buildings, etc.), Nontransient Noncommunity Water Supplies (including schools, businesses, childcare providers, Michigan Head Start locations, motels, resorts, etc.), and Transient Noncommunity Water Supplies (children’s camps and medical care providers).*Results are provided in parts per trillion. A part per trillion (ppt) is the equivalent of 1 drop of water in 20 Olympic-size swimming poolsDefinitions of the information provided in the sampling results table:WSSN: Water Supply Serial Number; unique identifier for each public water supplyCollection Date: The date samples were taken at the water supply.The System Type column lists the type of public water supplyCWS: Community Water Supply (Type I)NCWS: Noncommunity Water Supply (Type II)Non-transient: Non-transient noncommunity water supplies (Type II) are monitored for compliance under Michigan's SDWA.ADFSTC: Non-Community Water Supply (Adult Foster Care Provider)CHLCMP: Non-Community Water Supply (Children's Camp)DAYCARE: Non-Community Water Supply (Child Care Provider)INDUS: Non-Community Water Supply (Industry)MEDCAR: Non-Community Water Supply (Medical Care Provider)MOTEL: Non-Community Water Supply (Hotel or Motel)MUN: Community Water Supply (for example Municipal Supply, Apartment, Nursing Home, Prison, etc.)PFAS analytes are listed in individual columns (ppt). These include the 18 PFAS compounds tested under EPA method 537.1. If the result listed is &amp;quot;ND&amp;quot; the lab did not detect, or find, that PFAS was in the water sample above the method reporting limit.HFPO-DA (Hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid, also referred to as &amp;quot;GenX&amp;quot;) is a regulated analyte in Michigan with an MCL = 370 pptPFBS (Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid) is a regulated analyte in Michigan with an MCL = 420 pptPFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid) is a regulated analyte in Michigan with an MCL = 400,000 pptPFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid) is a regulated analyte in Michigan with an MCL = 51 pptPFNA (perfluorononanoic acid) is a regulated analyte in Michigan with an MCL = 6 pptPFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) is a regulated analyte in Michigan with an MCL = 8 pptPFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) is a regulated analyte in Michigan with an MCL = 16 ppt11Cl-PF3OUdS (11-chloroeicosafluoro-3-oxaundecane-1-sulfonic Acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in Michigan9Cl-PF3ONS (9-chlorohexadecafluoro-3-oxanone-1-sulfonic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganADONA (4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganNEtFOSAA (2-(N-ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamido) acetic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganNMeFOSAA (2-(N-methylperfluorooctanesulfonamido) acetic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganPFDA (perfluorodecanoic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganPFDoA (perfluorododecanoic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganPFHpA (perfluoroheptanoic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganPFTA (perfluorotetradecanoic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganPFTrDA (perfluorotridecanoic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganPFUnA (perfluoroundecanoic acid) is currently a non-regulated analyte in MichiganSample Number: The identification number that corresponds to the sample taken.Lab Name: Laboratory providing PFAS analysis via EPA method 537.1.Site Code: Specific sample location, when applicable.na: not applicableTaskType: To be used as a way to differentiate the Statewide Surveillance PFAS data (StateSurv) versus the PFAS Compliance Monitoring data (ComplMon).LabNumber: The certified lab code number to help clarify when the LabNameCode values vary, but are actually the same lab (issue with data coming from two different databases).  Statewide Surveillance data has null values for this.The data represents the PFAS sample locations, with each location having multiple samples taken, dates for each sample, and the analytical results for each sample. These analytical results include detections for 14 – 28 PFAS analytes, depending on the analytical method used. Each result has a &amp;quot;flags&amp;quot; column that corresponds to important data qualifiers.Understanding the flags: Contaminant data often include flags, also known as qualifiers, which are notes attached to data that gives detailed information about that particular result. In the drinking water PFAS data layer, PFAS analytes associated with a “U” flag were not detected in the sample and therefore a null value is displayed. “J” flagged results indicates an estimated concentration as the result is above the minimum detection limit (MDL) but below the laboratory reporting limit.  “J-“ flagged results indicates an estimated concentration as the result is above the minimum MDL, below the laboratory reporting limit, but biased low.  “UJ” flagged results indicates a not detected at the value estimated reporting limit.  “R” flagged results indicates a rejected sample as serious quality control issues render the result value bot usable.  “*” flagged results indicates that the result values have not been verified.This contains one hexbins layer (3 miles in height) showing the general location of the water sampling. The hexbins were created by EGLE using ArcGIS Online's Aggregate Points tool. The layer contains one field called &amp;quot;Hexagon ID&amp;quot; that connects the general location with the results of samples found within the hexbin area. The results are found in a related table &amp;quot;Statewide Testing Initiative of Public Water Supplies Sampling Results&amp;quot;. There is no precise location attached to the results for security. However, the table does contain a field &amp;quot;Hexagon ID&amp;quot; that connects the the result with the general location symbolized by the hexagon layer. The units for all drinking water PFAS results are measured
in PPT (parts per trillion).This data is used in the MPART: PFAS Geographic Information System (item details).

            <purpose>The data includes information on the State of Michigan funded drinking water Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) sampling effort, including, but not limited to, sample location, sample date, sample results, etc. There are two data sets associated with this: 1. a hexbins layer showing the general location of all samples and 2. a results table showing the sample results. This data is static and was last pulled 1/31/23. The units for all drinking water PFAS results are measured in PPT (parts per trillion).</purpose>
