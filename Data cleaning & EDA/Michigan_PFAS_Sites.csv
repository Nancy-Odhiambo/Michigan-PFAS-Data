After high concentrations of dry-cleaning solvents were discovered in soils by the property owner, groundwater monitoring wells were installed by the state during and after limited soils excavation and treatment.  In 2022, four monitoring wells were sampled for PFAS, and results were below criteria.  In 2023, a network of monitoring wells was sampled for PFAS.  One shallow monitoring well sampled twice had PFOA of 10 ppt (compared to 8 ppt) in the spring and 9.5 ppt in the fall.  The distribution of PFAS in groundwater confirmed that the former dry cleaner is the probable source of PFAS above criteria.  

The PFAS and chlorinated solvent groundwater contamination plume flows to the northeast towards the Grand River.  Public sanitary sewers and storm sewers are within the shallow groundwater contamination plume, and since storm sewers empty into the Grand River, it’s possible that some contamination may be reaching the river.","The area is served by Eaton Rapids municipal water, which was sampled five times to include 2023.

The site is an active plating facility that conducts decorative chrome electroplating primarily on plastic automotive parts, but also on plumbing fixtures, household appliances and business machines. Lacks has operated at this location since approximately 2005. Samples of storm water were collected at the facility in 2021 and 2022 as part of a Storm Water Characterization Study and PFOS was as high as 784 ppt (compared to 12 ppt) and copper as high as 0.70 milligrams per liter (mg/L). A thorough investigation of the storm water drainage system onsite led to the discovery of a faulty sump in the metal plating area of the facility, where plating solution was released into the soil, and then transported through the stormwater system via fractured piping in the subsurface. The source was subsequently isolated from the stormwater system, the fractured piping was replaced with closed PVC piping, and the sump was replaced. 

Lacks conducted a soil boring investigation throughout the plating area of the facility in October 2022 which included collecting soil samples for analysis of metals, hexavalent chromium, sulfate, chloride and PFAS. Analytical results identified elevated levels of chloride, sulfide, copper, selenium, and PFOS in soil within the vicinity of the replaced sump, with a maximum PFOS soil concentration of 180,000 ppt. A sediment sample collected at the storm water outfall south of the facility contained PFOS at a concentration of 840 ppt. There is no soil or sediment criteria.

In December 2022, EGLE Water Resources Division (WRD) sent a violation of outfall discharge permit notice to Lacks, and EGLE Remediation and Redevelopment Division (RRD) sent a compliance communication requesting compliance with Part 201 obligations for their facility. Lacks continued their investigation in July 2023 by collecting water samples from storm water catch basins and collecting groundwater samples adjacent to the storm water drain system to the north, west, and south of the facility. This sampling identified elevated concentrations of copper, chloride, PFOS and PFOA. The maximum concentration of PFOA in groundwater was 13 ppt (compared to 8 ppt) and the maximum concentration of PFOS in groundwater was 580 ppt (compared to 16 ppt). Additional investigations activities are expected to be conducted throughout 2024.

Groundwater flow is believed to be south toward the stormwater outfall, which empties into a tributary of Plaster Creek approximately 200 feet to the south of the outfall.

When PFAS was first detected at low levels in one of the wells - called the Clarkston Gardens Well, the well was taken offline and no longer used as a source of drinking water. In 2020, an additional well - Chestnut Hills Well - area had low level detections of PFAS and was also taken offline.  
In the spring of 2023, the Township reached out to MPART to help coordinate sampling of shallow groundwater and residential wells near the Ben Powell/Clarkston Landfill (which was in operation from the 1940s to 1978).  Groundwater sampling was conducted at several locations near the landfill and the highest result was 21 ppt PFOA (compared to 16 ppt).  In February 2024, the originally posted Independence Township Area of Interest became an official MPART site because of exceedances in groundwater and the landfill being determined to be the source of PFAS contamination.
Groundwater is assumed to flow to the south/southwest towards Park Lake.  
","Municipal water is available in portions of the Township.  In 2023, the Township received $5.4 million in funding to extend watermains to homes in the affected area.  Construction is slated to begin in Fall 2024.  The Township is in the planning phase for additional water main extensions for PFAS mitigation for FY25.
In April 2023, the Township hired an engineering consultant to sample private drinking water wells, starting with homes closest to the landfill.  Residential well sampling was conducted in several phases and considered other potential sources of PFAS in the area.  Forty-four (44) residential wells were sampled, six (6) of which had detections below the drinking water criteria; the rest of which were non-detect. Independence Township met with EGLE, DHHS, and local health department staff after each phase of the investigation to discuss results and next steps.
Some residents will be connected to municipal water as part of infrastructure projects that were and currently being planned for.  These projects will include all of the homes that had detections of PFAS in their drinking water well.
","A small subset of samples will be collected, in addition to the original 44 samples to be re-sampled in Spring 2024.

The Township will also be researching potential locations for new drinking water wells due to the Clarkston Gardens and Chestnut Hills being taken offline.

The manufacturing plant produces paper pulp and is adjacent to a warehouse where post-consumer recycled material was stored for use in the manufacturing process. On October 6, 2022, a large-scale industrial fire at the adjoining warehouse owned by KK Integrated Logistics and further impacted portions of the warehouse occupied by ChemDesign and Tyco/Johnson Controls. The adjoining warehouse contained numerous containers of chemicals, including Class B firefighting foam known to contain PFAS. Firefighting teams and incident management agencies responded, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Water was initially used to fight the fire, but as the fire continued, a Class A foam was used to aid in firefighting operations. The fire was completely extinguished by October 20, 2022.
Early on, some firefighting water entered the river, which was a concern because the river flows into Green Bay, which is where the drinking water intakes are located for the cities of Menominee, Michigan and Marinette, Wisconsin. Earth berms were installed quickly onsite and large holding tanks were mobilized to contain most of the fire water during continued firefighting operations. Over 5.5 million gallons of firewater were captured onsite in a combination of frac tanks, a large constructed bermed pond, and constructed holding tanks. Water contained in the pond was later pumped into holding tanks and the pond was deconstructed. In early November 2022, a treatment system was constructed onsite to treat the water in the holding tanks before it was discharged into the river or pumped to the Menominee Wastewater Treatment Plant for additional treatment.

During firefighting operations, sampling for PFAS occurred at the Menominee Water Treatment Plant (which serves drinking water to nearby residents in Menominee, Michigan), the Menominee Wastewater Treatment Plant, the Marinette Water Treatment and Wastewater Treatment systems, and along the Menominee River. EGLE, the City of Menominee, Michigan, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), the City of Marinette, Wisconsin, and local health departments from both states coordinated efforts to sample surface water in the Menominee River, the ""raw"" lake water (the water going into the water treatment plant) and ""treated water"" (water that comes out of the water treatment plant used for drinking water) during and following the fire response.  

Fire debris, including paper waste and pulp, was transported to one of two solid waste landfills in Michigan and Wisconsin. As of November 11, 2022, over 36,000 tons of fire debris material had been transported off site. Firefighting foam that was compromised and spilled within a portion of the impacted warehouse was vacuumed into containers and transported to a waste facility in Oregon for disposal. Waste was characterized before transport and disposal.

Groundwater analytical results for the PFAS compounds PFOA and PFOS exceeded drinking water and groundwater criteria.  The BEA identified the landfill as a potential source of contamination.  

On June 24, 2024, EGLE sampled groundwater at six monitoring wells for PFAS from the landfill property.  The highest groundwater results were 110 ppt PFOA (compared to 8 ppt) and 510 ppt PFOS (compared to 16 ppt). 

An on-site groundwater flow study has not occurred.  Based on the topography, groundwater flow is to the southeast direction.  
","From 2021 through 2023, under a separate investigation, nearby residential wells and public drinking water wells were sampled for PFAS in the vicinity of the former Anderson Landfill due to two dewatering projects on Eight Mile Road and Nine Mile Road that staff were concerned could change groundwater flow and impact nearby drinking water wells.  Drinking water wells were sampled for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PFAS, and the results were non-detect.  In 2022, public drinking water wells at ITC Park, Maybury State Park, and Little Seeds Northville Day Care were sampled for PFAS.  Results were non-detect, excluding a drinking water well at Oak Trail in Maybury State Park.  The Oak Trail well had detections of PFOA at 6 ppt and 8 ppt (compared to 8 ppt), and the detections were determined to be unrelated to the landfill. The DNR has taken the well out of service. 

To the east of the Anderson Landfill is an area slated to become a new subdivision.   In September through October of 2023, the developer, Parc Vista installed a dewatering system to lower the water table to facilitate the construction and connection of a sanitary sewer system to the main sanitary line located in the Eight Mile Road right-of-way (ROW).  During dewatering activities, four monitoring wells were installed in the Eight Mile Road ROW for sampling purposes and to measure groundwater elevations.  These monitoring wells and the dewatering discharge location along Eight Mile Road were sampled weekly for PFAS.  Analytical results indicated that PFAS results were non-detect for all samples in all locations. Parc Vista will restrict groundwater usage due to the PFAS detections from the former landfill.  Drinking water will be supplied by Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA).

The property west of the former landfill, Former Holloway Sand & Gravel, was purchased by the City of Novi in early 2024.
