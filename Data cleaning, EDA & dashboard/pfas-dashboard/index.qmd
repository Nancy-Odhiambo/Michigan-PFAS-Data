# Project Overview 🧭  
This project presents the **Michigan PFAS Dashboard**, an interactive data visualization tool that explores PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) contamination across Michigan.  

Built with **R** and **Quarto**, the dashboard combines data from surface water, public water supplies, and known contamination sites to support environmental research and policy decision-making.

## Introduction 📖  
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of man-made chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). These chemicals have been widely used in manufacturing, firefighting, and consumer products.  

Because PFAS are highly persistent in the environment and in the human body, they can accumulate over time and pose potential health risks.  

PFAS contamination in Michigan has raised significant public health and environmental concerns, echoing past environmental advocacy efforts such as those led by Erin Brockovich.  

This project aims to make PFAS-related data more accessible and easier to explore through an **interactive dashboard**.  

The dashboard allows users to visualize PFAS concentrations in surface water, public water supplies, and known contamination sites across Michigan. By improving access to PFAS data, the dashboard supports **research, policy discussions, and public awareness**.

## Project Summary 🔍  
This section outlines the **workflow** that integrates and cleans multiple PFAS datasets, applies geospatial identifiers, and visualizes contamination patterns.  

The dashboard serves as both an **analytical** and **educational** tool, designed to help users understand the scope and implications of PFAS contamination in Michigan.
