# Michigan PFAS Data

## Description  

From the state of Michigan's website:  

PFAS are a large group of man-made chemicals that include **perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)** and **perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS)**. PFAS have been used globally during the past century in manufacturing, firefighting, and thousands of common household and consumer products. These chemicals are persistent in the environment and in the human body ‚Äî meaning they don't break down and can accumulate over time.  

In recent years, experts have become increasingly concerned about the potential effects of high concentrations of PFAS on human health.  

PFAS contamination in West Michigan has unfortunately made headlines, reminiscent of other environmental advocacy efforts like that of renowned whistleblower Erin Brockovich.
